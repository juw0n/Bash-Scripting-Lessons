This is my Notes of some cloud computing scripting commands.
# To count the number of word in a file
1. wc -w "fileName"
# To Display the content of a file (one of many e.g vim, emac, nano)
2. cat "fileName"
# To Open a file, use any available editor (e.g vim, emac, nano)
3. vim "fileName"
# To get help or more information about a command, use either(man, help or info)
4. man "commandName"
